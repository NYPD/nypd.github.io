Kinda a Subaru fanboy, but love all 90\u0026rsquo;s JDM cars especially Group A rally cars. My first JDM car was a 1994 Subaru STi. This purchase caused me to fall in love with the whole import idea that I then sold my 2017 Subaru Crosstrek daily driver (RIP first car purchase) to buy a 1996 Toyota Celica. Not terribly knowledgeable on car mechanics, but know enough to take things apart and perhaps put it back together.\nAs far as this blog is concerned i\u0026rsquo;m publishing it to give back to the JDM community and hopefully help out a few people out there with their own vehicle projects. If there are any spelling mistakes or any wrong information please let me know via a GitHub issue.\nThe JDM vehicles I currently own are:\n1994 Subaru WRX STi Restoration car, trying to keep everything mostly OEM\n1996 Toyota Celica ST205 Daily driver\n1996 Daihatsu Hijet Future off-road worthy truck\n"
