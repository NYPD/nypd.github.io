JDM enthusiast who will never drive another left-hand drive car again for as long as I live. Kinda a Subaru fanboy, but love all 90's JDM cars especially [Group A rally cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_A#Rally_Cars). My first JDM car was a 1994 Subaru STi. This purchase caused me to fall in love with the whole import idea that I then sold my 2017 Subaru Crosstrek daily driver ([RIP first car purchase](/images/2017-crosstrek.jpg)) to buy a 1996 Toyota Celica. Not terribly knowledgeable on car mechanics, but know enough to take things apart and perhaps put it back together.

As far as this blog is concerned i'm publishing it to give back to the JDM community and hopefully help out a few people out there with their own vehicle projects. If there are any spelling mistakes or any wrong information please let me know via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/NYPD/nypd.github.io/issues).

The JDM vehicles I currently own are:

![1994 Subaru WRX STi post body paint job](/images/about/sd/1994-sti.webp)*1994 Subaru WRX STi* *Restoration car, trying to keep everything mostly OEM*

![1996 Toyota Celica ST205 in field](/images/about/sd/1996-celica.webp)*1996 Toyota Celica ST205* *Daily driver*
