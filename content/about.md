JDM enthusiast and will never drive another left-hand drive car again for a long as I live. Kinda a Subaru fanboy, but love all 90's JDM cars especially [Group A rally cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_A#Rally_Cars). My first JDM car was a 1994 Subaru STi and fell in love with the whole import idea that I sold my 2017 Subaru Crosstrek ([RIP first car purchase](/images/2017-crosstrek.jpg)) to buy a 1996 Toyota Celica. Not terribly knowledgeable on car mechanics, but know enough to take things apart and perhaps put it back together.

As far as this blog is concerned i'm Publishing it to give back to the JDM community and hopefully help out a few people out there with their own vehicle projects.

The JDM vehicles I currently own are:
