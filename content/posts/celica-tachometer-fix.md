## The Problem

Upon buying my Toyota ST205 I noticed that the tachometer was not working properly. It would never go above 3k RPMs despite hard acceleration and the car would idle at 200 RPM which didn't quite seemed right. Here is a short video of how the tachometer behaved:

After some research online I [discovered a thread](https://www.alltrac.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=49471) that suggested replacing the capacitors on the tachometer as a potential fix. Luckily doing this fixed my issue and this post will briefly guide you on how to get to the tachometer and replace the capacitors yourself.

## Instrument Panel Trim Removal

The first step is to remove this trim piece:

 There are no screws holding it in place, so take your trim tool and slowly start popping off the tabs. Here are the locations of the metal tabs to place the most leverage on:
