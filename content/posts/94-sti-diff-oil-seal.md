## Intro

Changing this differential oil seal proved to be more difficult than it actual is. There is a lot of information on YouTube and various forums, but none of them actually apply to a 1994 Subaru STi. Early gen GC8s and or JDM vs USDM gc8s differ enough to make a small brain mechanic like me get confused. However, now that I've gone through this junk you can easily go through this guide and change the differential oil seals on your early gen GC8 on your own.

## My Problem

On the passenger side of the STi, there seemed to be a slow leak originating from the differential retainer:

It seemed to leak very very slowly. No pool of transmission fluid was found below the car, just a small dried up stain I noticed one day which led me down this entire adventure. So lets take this apart and figure out what is going on.

## Part Numbers and Special Tools Needed

This is what I needed for a 1994 Subaru STi. These part numbers
{{< rawhtml >}} <em><b>Might/Will Differ</b></em> {{< /rawhtml >}}
from your GC8 (Unless you are a fellow 94 STi bro or potentially if you have a 95/96 GC8).

- [Company 23 #511](https://www.company23.com/511)
  - Axle pin removal tool
- [Company 23 #560](https://www.company23.com/560)
  - Differential retainer removal tool
- 806730031
  - (Right diff oil seal)
- 806730032
  - (Left diff oil seal)
- 806975010
  - (Diff retainer o-rings) x2

You don't need to get the Company 23 tools, if you find something similar or want to use the OEM suggested tools feel free to do so. For example, the differential retainer removal tool suggested by Subaru is part # 18630AA000.

## Step 0

Before you forget, and while the car is on the ground, take a 32mm socket and loosen the axle nut(s) with a breaker bar (only if you need to remove the entire CV axle). After doing so lift up the vehicle safely and then drain the diff oil from the drain bolt as seen in one of the above images. I might be mistaken, but if you remove the retainer plate without draining the diff oil it is gonna be a messy situation.

## Undoing the Lower Control Arm

There are some videos and tutorials online showing you how to take everything off to be able to remove the CV axles. However, you should be able to remove the CV axles to get access to the diff retainer plate skipping 90% off those steps (at least it worked for me).

The first step is to remove the cotter pin and 19mm nut from the lower control arm ball joint and then using a [ball joint separator](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0797YY6XX) to pop it out. Once you successfully pop out the ball joint use a pry bar or some elbow grease to fully separate the ball joint and the lower control arm like so:

![Lower control arm separated from ball joint](/images/94-sti-oil-seal/sd/lower-control-arm-ball-joint-popped.webp) *Lower control arm separated from ball joint*

This should allow the suspension to sway enough for you to remove the CV axle without removing anything else.

## Removing the axle pin

First locate the axle pin on the inner CV joint. You will notice the the axle pin location has a tapered side and a non-tapered side:

![Tapered side of the inner CV joint](/images/94-sti-oil-seal/sd/cv-axle-tapered.webp) *Tapered*

![Non-tapered side of the inner CV joint](/images/94-sti-oil-seal/sd/cv-axle-not-tapered.webp) *Non-Tapered*

Spin the axle to where you see the non-tapered side and then use your axle pin removal tool to pop it out starting from that side (so the axle pin will come out of the non-tapered side). Should be fairly easy to remove, especially with the specialized tool:

## Pulling off the CV Axle

Now you should be able to slide off the inner CV joint from the axle stub with the axle pin removed:

![Inner CV axle slid off axle stub](/images/94-sti-oil-seal/sd/cv-axle-female-pulled.webp) *Inner CV axle slid off axle stub*

If you don't need to service the entire CV axle (replace worn boots or whatever) you should be able to place the inner Cv joint to the side and continue on to the next step. You might have to use some jet line or jam it somewhere so it stays out of the way.

If you do need to remove your entire CV axle, remove the axle nut that you loosened in an earlier step and you **should** be able to slide it off the hub. Its a little awkward to move around the CV axle under the car, but with a little creative placements you should get it out. My drivers side CV axle was able to removed easily by hand, my passenger side however, the outer CV joint was seized onto the hub. I had to use penetrating fluid and a hammer to knock it through the hub. Just take your time and try not to damage anything if one of you axles are stuck.
