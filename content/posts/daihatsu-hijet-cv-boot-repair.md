## Intro

After purchasing my Daihatsu Hijet I was informed by the mechanic from the location I went to get it serviced that my CV boots were torn and should be replaced soon (my friend's house I was staying at [literally has no tools cause the own a Tesla](https://c.tenor.com/U6L9ZrHicsgAAAAC/justin-timberlake-stare.gif)). So after the service shop shoved a ton of grease into the CV boots as a temporary fix, then [driving the Daihatsu Hijet all the way from Seattle to Denver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rc1zHrddzY), and ignoring the Hijet for a few months while I worked on other vehicles I finally got around to replacing the boots.

Provided you have all the tools needed to replace the boots it should only take a few hours complete. This guide will also make sure you don't take things apart out of order resulting in lots of wasted time assembling and disassembling the same components over and over again. That being said, obviously I am not a professional mechanic so some terminology might be off. Also I am not responsible for things going wrong.

Legal disclaimers out of the way, hopefully you find this guide helpful. This guide is specifically for a 1996 Daihatsu Hijet S110P, but should mostly be the same I believe for other model years and brands (Suzuki Carry, Honda Acty, Subaru Sambar, etc).

## Removing the Axle Hub Nut

So the first step is to loosen the axle hub nut. If going solo this should be done prior to jacking the vehicle up. Simply remove the wheel cap and use a breaker bar and a 32mm socket to break this bolt lose (remember to remove the cotter pin first). If you have a friend and jack up the car before this, your friend can simply press the brakes while you break some nuts. Also remove the axle hub washer on there too while you are at it.

Once the axle hub nut and washer is removed, take off the wheel and properly jack up the truck if you have not done so already:

## Loosening the Hub Bolts

With the tire and axle nut removed the next step is to break loose the hub nuts. These are 14mm and should not require much force. If they are proving to be pesky have someone press the brakes and use a breaker bar to knock them loose.

## Removing the Brake Caliper

To remove the brake caliper, first remove the brake line (12mm) nut shown here:

![Brake line bolt location](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/brake-line-nut.webp) *Brake line bolt location*

Then turn the steering wheel to allow you to easily fit a breaker bar behind the caliper and remove the bolts holding it on the knuckle (these are 17mm).

After you remove the brake caliper you can use the wheel you took off as an elevated platform to place the brake caliper on to not stress the brake line:

![Caliper removed laying on wheel](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/brake-caliper-removed.webp) *Caliper removed*

## Loosening the Bottom Strut Bolts

Next step is to brake loose the bottom two strut bolts. These are 17mm and require a 17mm wrench and a 17mm socket with a breaker bar. Just place both of those on the nut and bolt and have at it.

![Using a breaker bar to loosen the strut bolts on the suspension](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/strut-bolts-broken.webp) *Breaking the strut bolts loose*

Don't fully unbolt these just yet as you will need the rigidity of the suspension strut to remove other components. Just knock the two bolts loose and let them chill.

## Removing the Hub and Rotor

With the hub nuts loosen, its time to take them off and attempt to slide the hub off. An axle hub removal tool would probably be easier, but unfortunately I do not own one yet. What ended it up working for me was to use two pry bars to pry off the hub using the rotor as leverage.

![Prying off the hub using two pry bars](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/pry-bars-prying-hub.webp) *Prying off the hub using pry bars*

With a combination of prying and hammering with a rubber mallet the axle hub should slide out:

![Axle hub removed](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/hub-removed.webp) *Axle hub removed*

Then simply take off the dangling rotor and you are left with something that looks like this:

![Rotor removed exposing knuckle](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/hub-and-rotor-removed.webp) *Rotor removed exposing knuckle*

## Disconnecting the Tie Rod and Lower Control Arm

In order to disconnect these you need to first remove the castle nuts holding them on.

![Tie rod castle nut](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/tier-rod-castle-nut.webp) *Tie rod castle nut location*

![Lower control arm castle nut location](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/lower-control-arm-nut.webp) *Lower control arm castle nut location*

Simply remove the cotter pin on them and use a 17mm wrench or socket to remove them. You might need a breaker bar, but I was able to remove them with a bit of elbow grease.

![Castle nuts removed from tier rod and lower control arm](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/castle-nuts-removed.webp) *Both castle nuts removed*

Now its time for the jump scare. The lower control arm ball joint and tier rod end bolts are usually seized up on the knuckle. To remove them we need to use a ball join separator:

![Ball joint separator side](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/ball-joint-seperator-side.webp) *Ball joint separator side*

![Ball joint separator front](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/ball-joint-seperator-front.webp) *Ball joint separator front*

You could also use a pickle fork, but these have a tendency on ripping up the rubber boot on these joints. Simply slide the ball joint separator over the ball joint making sure to center everything so you don't damage the bolt like so:

![Ball joint separator placed on tier rod end](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/ball-joint-seperator-on-tie-rod-end.webp) *Ball joint separator placed on tie rod end*

And then using a breaker bar with a 24mm socket (your ball joint separator might have a different size) slowly tighten the ball join separator until you get jumped scared by the loud pop it makes when it releases.

![Ball joint separator with breaker bar](/images/daihatsu-cv-boot-repair/sd/ball-joint-seperator-with-braker-bar.webp) *Ball joint separator with breaker bar*

Remember the key here is to push the bolt out of the knuckle hole, so place the ball joint in the correct orientation. To prevent the tie rod from slamming down out of the knuckle, thread on the castle nut on the bolt leaving a bit of room for the tie rod end to come loose. This is done prior to placing the ball joint separator and will protect the bolt from and damage. As for the lower control arm ball joint, there is not enough room on the S110P to place the castle nut over the bolt and slide the ball joint separator on. So just line up the ball join separator the best you can. Try to place something underneath the lower control arm to "catch it" when it pops out of the knuckle (in my case I used the tire).

## Removing the Suspension Strut

Once the jump scares are out of the way, next its time to remove the strut suspension. Undo the 12mm nuts from the top of the strut (beneath the seats) and remove the lower strut bolts you loosened earlier.

## Removing the CV Axle

With everything else removed all you have to do now is literally yank out the CV axle from the differential on the transmission housing. This should come out with relatively low force.
