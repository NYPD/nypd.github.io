## Intro

After purchasing my Daihatsu Hijet I was informed by the mechanic from the location I went to get it serviced that my CV boots were torn and should be replaced soon (my friend's house I was staying at [literally has no tools cause the own a Tesla](https://c.tenor.com/U6L9ZrHicsgAAAAC/justin-timberlake-stare.gif)). So after the service shop shoved a ton of grease into the CV boots as a temporary fix, then [driving the Daihatsu Hijet all the way from Seattle to Denver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rc1zHrddzY), and ignoring the Hijet for a few months while I worked on other vehicles I finally got around to replacing the boots.

Provided you have all the tools needed to replace the boots it should only take a few hours complete. This guide will also make sure you don't take things apart out of order resulting in lots of wasted time assembling and disassembling the same components over and over again (i'm dumb).
