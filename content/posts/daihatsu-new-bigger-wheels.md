## Intro

My plan for the Daihatsu Hijet is to convert it to a capable off-road worthy truck. After getting the basic maintenance out of the way, the next logical step is to install a lift kit and add bigger tires. In the off-road world it is all about ground clearance and angles. Being such a tiny truck the Daihatsu already has some pretty good approach, breakover, and departure angles. However, ground clearance is pretty mediocre with about 6" of ground clearance from the lowest point (the rear diff).
