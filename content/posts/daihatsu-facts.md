This post will serve as a collection of useful info I wish I could have easily looked up rather than figure out myself.

## Misc

        A battery for a 2014 Toyota Prius plug-in fits perfectly. <a href="https://www.batteriesplus.com/productdetails/sli51pagm?variationCode=VI814692" target="_blank">This one</a> fit just fine on my Daihatsu. I did have to install the battery backwards since the stock battery cables were not long enough to reach. <br><br>
        One thing to note is that the existing battery retainer bracket might not fit properly if you get a bigger battery. Something to keep in mind.
