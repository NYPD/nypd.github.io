## Intro

So you bought yourself a JDM ST205 and want to upgrade the sound system to the 21st century? Well you are in luck as the process is very straight forward and hopefully with this article you will be able to do it easily and be ready for any roadblocks that I've run into.  

This article is not a complete guide and will assume you are capable of removing panels, soldering connections, crafting mounts, etc.

## Equipment Used

These are just the equipment I used for this project, feel free to swap whatever with your preferred brands.

## Interior Removal

So the first easy step to start this process is the removal of all the interior trim and rear seats to get access to the OEM speakers. Compared to other JDM cars I have worked with (just a Subaru GC8) this Celica has been simpler in my opinion.

The door cards/panels were straight forward. They both had two/tree plastic plugs that had screws underneath, so just pop the plugs with your plastic trim tools and undo the screws. There was also a hidden screw under the inner door handle plastic cup as seen here:

![Inner door handle cup removed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/door-handle-cup-removed.jpg) *Passenger door handle trim cup removed*

Then once you remove all these screws and plastic retainers and with a little bit of wiggling, you can remove the door panels/cards very easily.

![Passenger door panel removal](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/door-panel-off.jpg) *Passenger door panel removed*

After this you can start the removal of the rear seats and the rear side trim (the trim that contains the rear speakers). This as well is very simple. The rear speaker grilles can be popped off with a trim tool to reveal additional screws to remove. The only small tricky part I recall is the bottom portion of the rear seat, once you unbolt everything, you have to yank the front part of it out from the car frame. It is connected by two metal hooks that lock into the "lock hook" mechanism. The red circles on the image show where these hooks go into.

![Rear seat and trim removed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-seat-off-and-trim.jpg) *Rear seat and trim removed. Red circle shows the hook lock (there is another one on the other side)*

Once you are done removing all the necessary trim you can now unplug and unscrew both the front and rear speakers. Now since your Celica is over 25 years old they will prob look a little bit like this:

![Old front speakers](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/old-front-speakers.jpg) *Old front speakers*

![Old rear speakers](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-old-speakers.jpg) *Old rear speakers*

The front speaker diaphragms were a bit petrified and the foam was starting to fall apart. The rears faired a bit better, but still in a poor state. I'm not too knowledgeable when it comes to speaker technology, but to me this is one of the downsides to using paper as a woofer material. Humid conditions, like the ones found in Japan, lead to a deterioration in the speakers over time. Now granted this is over 25+ years, but i'm sure if polypropylene cones were used back then (if the technology existed in the 90's not sure) the old oem speakers would have held off much better. I'm sure paper technology and chemical coatings have come a long way since then, but im still hesitant to use or recommend paper speaker woofers because of this. These were not so bad compared to the ones found on my 1994 WRX STi:

![Old GC8 speaker](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/old-gc8-speaker.jpg) *Really old and petrified 1994 WRX STi speaker*

Regardless, with this mini rant out of the way lets move on to the next section.

## Installing the new speakers

Take the new speakers you ordered, remove them from their packaging, and then come to the realization that they do not fit properly and the included speaker adapters won't work either. Unfortunately I ran into this issue when my small brain blindly trusted Crutchfield that a 6.5" speaker will work in the front and a 5.25" speaker will work in the back.

Now on the Mr. Brightside I wanted to use the Polk Audio DB speakers regardless as they are reviewed very well and I have used them in my 94 STi and liked the quality. Here are the new speaker in comparison to the Celica speaker brackets:

![Polk Audio DB6502 inside front Celica speaker bracket](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-new-speaker-inside-old-frame.jpg) *Polk Audio DB6502 inside front Celica speaker bracket*

![Polk Audio DB5252 inside rear Celica speaker bracket](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-new-speaker-inside-old-frame.jpg) *Polk Audio DB5252 inside rear Celica speaker bracket*

As you can see the mounting screws do not line up properly on either bracket. The front speaker brackets have a screw spacing of 8" and the rear speaker bracket has a screw spacing of 6.25". I can't recall exactly, but I kinda remember trying the 6.25" DB6502 speaker in the rear and it *STILL* did not line up properly. Looking online I found some threads stating certain 8" speakers worked like the [Focal ISU 200](https://www.focal.com/en/car-audio/car-audio-kits-solutions/integration/universal/component-kits/isu200) will work on the front speaker bracket without any modifications, but chances are the speakers you prefer or want buy will require some modification and crafting.

Hopefully you are better equipped than me, but all the following custom speaker adapters were done with just a [Dremel 4000-6/50](https://us.dremel.com/en_US/products/-/show-product/tools/4000-6-50-high-performance-rotary-tool-kit?bvroute=Reviews%2FshowHelpfulPositive). The adapters a little sloppy around the edges, but It did not turn out too bad.

### Rear speakers

I first started by removing the old speakers from the bracket (you will need to desolder the wire connections as they hardwired/soldered on). Then I flipped the speaker over a birch plywood I bought from Home Depot and drew a rough outline of the built in adapter frame the old speaker had. In the middle of the outline I then drew a circle slightly smaller than the DB5252 speaker to allow the speaker edge to rest on the plywood and not fall through.

![Rear speaker adapter outline on a birch plywood](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-speaker-adapter-outline.jpg) *Birch plywood with rear speaker adapter outline*

This is the [birch plywood squares](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Handprint-1-4-in-x-12-in-x-12-in-Birch-Plywood-438046/315171651) i bought from Home Depot:

![Birch plywood square](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/birch-plywood.jpg) *Birch plywood square bought at Home Depot*

With the aftermath of a lot sawdust everywhere, I drilled out the outlines with the Dremel:

![Rear speaker adapter cut out](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-speaker-adapter-hole-cut.jpg) *Rear speaker adapter cutout*

And was able to secure the speaker with cheap nuts and bolts I have bought from Harbor Freight:

![Rear speaker adapter complete](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-new-speaker-adapter.jpg) *Rear speaker adapter complete*

Like I mentioned before if you have proper equipment this part would not be so bad. I went through a few birch plywoods before I finally cut one half way decent. If you do not have better equipment or have the same mediocre woodwork skills as me, making these brackets will take a little bit of time, but should not hamper your progress. If possible might I suggest trying to create these brackets out of plastic rather than birch wood for increased durability and humidity resistance. Once finished creating the brackets add a bit of [blue loctite 242](https://www.loctiteproducts.com/en/products/specialty-products/specialty/loctite_threadlockerblue242.html) (or equivalent) to prevent the nuts from shaking loose and a bit of foam as seen on the picture above to prevent any rattling against the speaker grille.

As far as the wiring in concerned, all I would recommend is to extend the existing cables you desoldered with a [16 gauge speaker wire](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_007CSW16/Crutchfield-Speaker-Wire-16-gauge.html) using the [Kuject butt connectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B073RMRCC3) and adding a spade connectors from the [Nilight Quick Disconnect Terminals](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V35375X) kit. The results will look something like so:

![Rear speaker wire extended with spade connectors attached](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-speaker-wire-extension.jpg) *Rear speaker wire extended with spade connectors attached*

![Rear speaker wire extension connected](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-speaker-wire-complete.jpg) *Rear speaker wire extension connected*

### Front Speakers

The front speaker adapters are much easier to cut out than the rears. The rears had this rounded square shape going on which made routing the outlines free handed with only a Dremel way too annoying. The front adapters are just a 8" diameter circle with another circle in the middle to let the front speakers rest on it. So unless you are buying an 8" speaker that will avoid all this your first step will be to remove the sticky sealant from the speaker and the frame.

![Cutting through the weatherstrip adhesive on the front speaker and bracket using a small pick](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-speaker-sticky-stuff.jpg) *Cutting through the weatherstrip adhesive on the front speaker and bracket using a small pick*

After you pry the speaker off and desolder the wires off, flip that speaker over on top your wood panel, trace the speaker outline and screw holes, and then start cutting.

![Front speaker flipped over on birch plywood](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-speaker-flipped-on-birch.jpg) *Front speaker flipped over on birch plywood*

![Front adapter fully cut](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-birch-adapter-inner-circle-cut.jpg) *Front adapter fully cut*

Once everything is fully cut mount the adapter to the front speaker bracket (make sure to add some [3M Weatherstrip adhesive](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b5005005008/) between the adapter and the bracket), attach the speaker and secure it with hardware, and finally add some foam to the edges of the adapter to prevent and rattling sounds of it hitting the door panel.

![Front speaker adapter complete with speaker installed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-speaker-adapters-new.jpg) *Front speaker adapter complete with speaker installed*

Now all you have to do is add some [spade connectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V35375X) to the wires you soldered and attach them to the speaker terminals.

## Center Console Trim Removal

Before moving on to the head unit, you will need to remove all the center console trim pieces to get access to the old cassette deck unit and remove it. Start off my removing the shift knob and then popping of the shift boot/cigarette lighter trim with your trim pry tools (don't forget to unplug the cigarette lighter wire before yanking it off) .

![Shift boot trim removed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/shift-boot-trim-removed.jpg) *Shift boot trim removed*

Now with this removed it will expose two screws which I have circled in red on the next image. Remove the screws and one again pop off the head unit trim with your trim tool.

![Prying off the head unit trim with a trim tool](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/head-unit-trim-removal.jpg) *Prying off the head unit trim with a trim tools*

Carefully disconnect the top two the connectors to this trim and set the trim aside. Now all you have left is to remove the actual head unit cage and disconnect the wiring harness from the cassette deck.

![Center console trim and head unit completely removed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/center-console-trim-removed.jpg#vertical) *Center console trim and head unit completely removed*

The two blue connectors you see in the image is the Celica's wiring harness. These will be diagramed and explained in the next section.

## Head Unit Connections

Luckily the JDM version of the Celica did not pose any additional difficulty when connecting the head unit wire connector to the receiver wiring harness. However, I did spend a lot of time cross referencing multiple sites including the Crutchfield "WireGuide™" to make sure everything lined up correctly. The following is an aggregation off all the information I have rounded up.

So first of all the head unit I went with is the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000). The big reason I went with this unit is that this specific model comes with a built-in amplifier which means I don't have to mess around with trying to find a spot to mount an external amplifier and take up the little amount of cargo room the Celica has. The built in amp has a 45 watt RMS and up to 100 watts peak which lines up well with the Polk Audio speakers I purchased and should be plenty of power to drive them (The polk audio speakers have a very high db sensitivity; 91/92 db).

The wire receiver harness I got (which came for free with my Crutchfield order) is the [Metra 70-1761 Receiver Wiring Harness](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_120701761/Metra-70-1761-Receiver-Wiring-Harness.html). This is what the head unit wires will connect to and then in turn connect to the Celica's wire harness.

So here is the Celica's wire harness connectors with a diagram of the wire **factory colors** that are attached to the connectors.

![Celica wire harness connectors](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/celica-wire-harness-connectors.jpg) *Celica Wire Harness connectors*

![Main bigger wire harness connector (R3) diagram](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/wire-harness-connector-big.png) *Main bigger wire harness connector (R3) diagram [FL: Front Left, FR: Front Right]*

![Main smaller wire harness connector (R2) diagram](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/wire-harness-connector-small.png) *Main smaller wire harness connector (R2) diagram [RL: Rear Left, RR: Rear Right]*

Note that these colors **DO NOT MATCH** the [Metra 70-1761 Receiver Wiring Harness](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_120701761/Metra-70-1761-Receiver-Wiring-Harness.html) nor the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) unit wires. I'm assuming the wire color scheme used in the ST205 was an old obsolete scheme or maybe just a random scheme, not entirely sure.

Now here are the actual connections you will need to make. I've also added connections for the backup camera and the parking override bypass.

To clear a little confusion from the first table, both the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) and the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10)were grounded to the chassis. Using a ring terminal the Sony was grounded to a nut/bolt behind the center console and the Kicker to the a nut/bolt on the driveshaft tunnel. Also the constant power from both the head-unit and powered sub were routed through the firewall and to the positive battery terminal, more on this in a later section.

For the the connections from the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) to the Metra wiring harness that were 1:1 the [Kuject butt connectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B073RMRCC3) were used. All other connections I used the [WAGO 221 LEVER-NUTS](https://www.wago.com/us/lp-221). The personal reason for this was to have the flexibility to add or remove cables from these "non-permanent" connections without worrying about having to cut and resolder the wires. This will be convenient in the event if a new electrical device gets added or removed.

All other wires that were not used were electrical taped off such as the Metra's yellow constant or the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) brown and green input wires.

## Subwoofer

So the subwoofer I went with was the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10) which is a compact self powered 10" sub. For the same reason I got the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) I went with a self powered sub to save as much space as possible. I could not afford to use up any trunk space to put in a boxed sub and find somewhere to mount an amplifier.

The best place I found to install this sub was under the passenger seat. With the addition of a few washers for the rear left bolt, the seat is able to slide back and forth without hitting the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10).

**However** the grille on the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10) does come in contact with the seat if there is someone sitting on the seat. The washers did help a bit, but to my knowledge there are only 3 options one can do to alleviate this or fix it completely.

1. Buy the smaller 8" [Kicker Hideaway HS8](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway)
    - It is 3-1/4" height vs 3-3/8"
2. Hammer in the grille on the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10)
    - The grille sticks out unnecessarily compared to the frame and can be hammered flat without sacrificing sound
3. Lift the actual passenger seat
    - This is a lot of work. I used some washers on the rear left bolt which aided a bit in raising the seat, but the rear right bolt on the passenger seat is bolted on the side of the driveshaft tunnel. So adding washers there would not accomplish anything. Some custom fabrication will be required

The option that I went with is option #4, none of the above. Having someone in the seat did not affect the bass in any way nor create any unwanted rattle. However, if this grows to be a concern in the future i will probably go with option #2 as its the easiest.

To conceal the wire connections, cutting/drilling a hole in the carpet near the bottom of the driveshaft tunnel proved to be quite good.

As seen in the picture above, I used a small step drill bit to cut a hole through the carpet. Make sure to cut this hole near the area where the connector on the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10) will  be to avoid any bending. The cables can then be ran up the driveshaft tunnel without any pinching and up to the center console location.

Connecting the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10) to the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) was really easy with the purchase of the [Kicker 46KISL car audio amp amplifier speaker wire](https://www.kicker.com/2-channel-speaker-rca-converter) and the [AudioQuest rca adapter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009MFRW0). Just use some [butt connectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B073RMRCC3) to connect the subwoofer harness audio wires to the Kicker 46KISL adapter. Then attach the adapter rca end to the AudioQuest RCA adapter and that to the sub-out port on the Sony XAV-AX7000. Since the harness and the RCA adapter are both from kicker the wire color scheme connections are really easy:

|                        | Kicker 46HS10 | Kicker 46KISL |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Left Channel Positive  | White         | White         |
| Left Channel Negative  | White/Black   | White/Black   |
| Right Channel Positive | Grey          | Grey          |
| Right Channel Negative | Text          | Grey/Black    |

Mounting the subwoofer is also really easy. The [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10) does come with a few mounting brackets inside, but there was no real way to attach it to anything under the passenger seat. What I ended up doing is attaching two really long strips of double sided velcro to the back of the unit, but just using the side with the hooks so it can sink in and grab unto the carpet.

![Kicker 46HS10 with double sided adhesive velcro strap attached to the back of it](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/sub-with-velcro-strip.jpg) *Kicker 46HS10 with double sided adhesive velcro strap attached to the back of it*

Upon testing, once the velcro strips grab unto the carpet, it is not going anywhere. Keep in mind that removing this is a real pain in the butt unless you remove the passenger seat (learn from my dumb mistakes). Save this step for the end once everything else is done.

## Constant Battery Terminal Power

Both the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10) and the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/) are required/recommended to be connected directly to the car's positive battery terminal. This means you will have to run cables through the car's firewall. Luckily the ST205 has a convenient grommet you can go through on the passenger side.
