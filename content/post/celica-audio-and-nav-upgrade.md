## Intro

So you bought yourself a JDM ST205 and want to upgrade the sound system to the 21st century? Well you are in luck as the process is very straight forward and hopefully with this article you will be able to do it easily and be ready for any roadblocks that I've run into.  

This article is not a complete guide and will assume you are capable of removing panels, soldering connections, crafting mounts, etc.

## Equipment Used

These are just the equipment I used for this project, feel free to swap whatever with your preferred brands.

## Interior Removal

So the first easy step to start this process is the removal of all the interior trim and rear seats to get access to the OEM speakers. Compared to other JDM cars I have worked with (just a Subaru GC8) this Celica has been simpler in my opinion.

The door cards/panels were straight forward. They both had two/tree plastic plugs that had screws underneath, so just pop the plugs with your plastic trim tools and undo the screws. There was also a hidden screw under the inner door handle plastic cup as seen here:

![Inner door handle cup removed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/door-handle-cup-removed.jpg) *Passenger door handle trim cup removed*

Then once you remove all these screws and plastic retainers and with a little bit of wiggling, you can remove the door panels/cards very easily.

![Passenger door panel removal](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/door-panel-off.jpg) *Passenger door panel removed*

After this you can start the removal of the rear seats and the rear side trim (the trim that contains the rear speakers). This as well is very simple. The rear speaker grilles can be popped off with a trim tool to reveal additional screws to remove. The only small tricky part I recall is the bottom portion of the rear seat, once you unbolt everything, you have to yank the front part of it out from the car frame. It is connected by two metal hooks that lock into the "lock hook" mechanism. The red circles on the image show where these hooks go into.

![Rear seat and trim removed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-seat-off-and-trim.jpg) *Rear seat and trim removed. Red circle shows the hook lock (there is another one on the other side)*

Once you are done removing all the necessary trim you can now unplug and unscrew both the front and rear speakers. Now since your Celica is over 25 years old they will prob look a little bit like this:

![Old front speakers](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/old-front-speakers.jpg) *Old front speakers*

![Old rear speakers](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-old-speakers.jpg) *Old rear speakers*

The front speaker diaphragms were a bit petrified and the foam was starting to fall apart. The rears faired a bit better, but still in a poor state. I'm not too knowledgeable when it comes to speaker technology, but to me this is one of the downsides to using paper as a woofer material. Humid conditions, like the ones found in Japan, lead to a deterioration in the speakers over time. Now granted this is over 25+ years, but i'm sure if polypropylene cones were used back then (if the technology existed in the 90's not sure) the old oem speakers would have held off much better. I'm sure paper technology and chemical coatings have come a long way since then, but im still hesitant to use or recommend paper speaker woofers because of this. These were not so bad compared to the ones found on my 1994 WRX STi:

![Old GC8 speaker](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/old-gc8-speaker.jpg) *Really old and petrified 1994 WRX STi speaker*

Regardless, with this mini rant out of the way lets move on to the next section.

## Installing the new speakers

Take the new speakers you ordered, remove them from their packaging, and then come to the realization that they do not fit properly and the included speaker adapters won't work either. Unfortunately I ran into this issue when my small brain blindly trusted Crutchfield that a 6.5" speaker will work in the front and a 5.25" speaker will work in the back.

Now on the Mr. Brightside I wanted to use the Polk Audio DB speakers regardless as they are reviewed very well and I have used them in my 94 STi and liked the quality. Here are the new speaker in comparison to the Celica speaker brackets:

![Polk Audio DB6502 inside front Celica speaker bracket](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-new-speaker-inside-old-frame.jpg) *Polk Audio DB6502 inside front Celica speaker bracket*

![Polk Audio DB5252 inside rear Celica speaker bracket](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-new-speaker-inside-old-frame.jpg) *Polk Audio DB5252 inside rear Celica speaker bracket*

As you can see the mounting screws do not line up properly on either bracket. The front speaker brackets have a screw spacing of 8" and the rear speaker bracket has a screw spacing of 6.25". I can't recall exactly, but I kinda remember trying the 6.25" DB6502 speaker in the rear and it **STILL** did not line up properly. Looking online I found some threads stating certain 8" speakers worked like the [Focal ISU 200](https://www.focal.com/en/car-audio/car-audio-kits-solutions/integration/universal/component-kits/isu200) will work on the front speaker bracket without any modifications, but chances are the speakers you prefer or want to buy will require some modification and crafting.

Hopefully you are better equipped than me, but all the following custom speaker adapters were done with just a [Dremel 4000-6/50](https://us.dremel.com/en_US/products/-/show-product/tools/4000-6-50-high-performance-rotary-tool-kit?bvroute=Reviews%2FshowHelpfulPositive). The adapters a little sloppy around the edges, but It did not turn out too bad.

### Rear speakers

I first started by removing the old speakers from the bracket (you will need to desolder the wire connections as they hardwired/soldered on). Then I flipped the speaker over a birch plywood I bought from Home Depot and drew a rough outline of the built in adapter frame the old speaker had. In the middle of the outline I then drew a circle slightly smaller than the DB5252 speaker to allow the speaker edge to rest on the plywood and not fall through.

![Rear speaker adapter outline on a birch plywood](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-speaker-adapter-outline.jpg) *Birch plywood with rear speaker adapter outline*

This is the [birch plywood squares](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Handprint-1-4-in-x-12-in-x-12-in-Birch-Plywood-438046/315171651) i bought from Home Depot:

![Birch plywood square](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/birch-plywood.jpg) *Birch plywood square bought at Home Depot*

With the aftermath of a lot sawdust everywhere, I drilled out the outlines with the Dremel:

![Rear speaker adapter cut out](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-speaker-adapter-hole-cut.jpg) *Rear speaker adapter cutout*

And was able to secure the speaker with cheap nuts and bolts I have bought from Harbor Freight:

![Rear speaker adapter complete](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-new-speaker-adapter.jpg) *Rear speaker adapter complete*

Like I mentioned before if you have proper equipment this part would not be so bad. I went through a few birch plywoods before I finally cut one half way decent. If you do not have better equipment or have the same mediocre woodwork skills as me, making these brackets will take a little bit of time, but should not hamper your progress. If possible might I suggest trying to create these brackets out of plastic rather than birch wood for increased durability and humidity resistance. Once finished creating the brackets add a bit of [blue loctite 242](https://www.loctiteproducts.com/en/products/specialty-products/specialty/loctite_threadlockerblue242.html) (or equivalent) to prevent the nuts from shaking loose and a bit of foam as seen on the picture above to prevent any rattling against the speaker grille.

As far as the wiring in concerned, all I would recommend is to extend the existing cables you desoldered with a [16 gauge speaker wire](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_007CSW16/Crutchfield-Speaker-Wire-16-gauge.html) using the [Kuject butt connectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B073RMRCC3) and adding a spade connectors from the [Nilight Quick Disconnect Terminals](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V35375X) kit. The results will look something like so:

![Rear speaker wire extended with spade connectors attached](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-speaker-wire-extension.jpg) *Rear speaker wire extended with spade connectors attached*

![Rear speaker wire extension connected](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-speaker-wire-complete.jpg) *Rear speaker wire extension connected*

### Front Speakers

The front speaker adapters are much easier to cut out than the rears. The rears had this rounded square shape going on which made routing the outlines free handed with only a Dremel way too annoying. The front adapters are just a 8" diameter circle with another circle in the middle to let the front speakers rest on it. So unless you are buying an 8" speaker that will avoid all this your first step will be to remove the sticky sealant from the speaker and the frame.

![Cutting through the weatherstrip adhesive on the front speaker and bracket using a small pick](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-speaker-sticky-stuff.jpg) *Cutting through the weatherstrip adhesive on the front speaker and bracket using a small pick*

After you pry the speaker off and desolder the wires off, flip that speaker over on top your wood panel, trace the speaker outline and screw holes, and then start cutting.

![Front speaker flipped over on birch plywood](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-speaker-flipped-on-birch.jpg) *Front speaker flipped over on birch plywood*

![Front adapter fully cut](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-birch-adapter-inner-circle-cut.jpg) *Front adapter fully cut*

Once everything is fully cut mount the adapter to the front speaker bracket (make sure to add some [3M Weatherstrip adhesive](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b5005005008/) between the adapter and the bracket), attach the speaker and secure it with hardware, and finally add some foam to the edges of the adapter to prevent and rattling sounds of it hitting the door panel.

![Front speaker adapter complete with speaker installed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-speaker-adapters-new.jpg) *Front speaker adapter complete with speaker installed*

Now all you have to do is add some [spade connectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V35375X) to the wires you soldered and attach them to the speaker terminals.

## Center Console Trim Removal

Before moving on to the head unit, you will need to remove all the center console trim pieces to get access to the old cassette deck unit and remove it. Start off my removing the shift knob and then popping of the shift boot/cigarette lighter trim with your trim pry tools (don't forget to unplug the cigarette lighter wire before yanking it off) .

![Shift boot trim removed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/shift-boot-trim-removed.jpg) *Shift boot trim removed*

Now with this removed it will expose two screws which I have circled in red on the next image. Remove the screws and one again pop off the head unit trim with your trim tool.

![Prying off the head unit trim with a trim tool](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/head-unit-trim-removal.jpg) *Prying off the head unit trim with a trim tools*

Carefully disconnect the top two the connectors to this trim and set the trim aside. Now all you have left is to remove the actual head unit cage and disconnect the wiring harness from the cassette deck.

![Center console trim and head unit completely removed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/center-console-trim-removed.jpg#vertical) *Center console trim and head unit completely removed*

The two blue connectors you see in the image is the Celica's wiring harness. These will be diagramed and explained in the next section.

## Head Unit Connections

Luckily the JDM version of the Celica did not pose any additional difficulty when connecting the head unit wire connector to the receiver wiring harness. However, I did spend a lot of time cross referencing multiple sites including the Crutchfield "WireGuide™" to make sure everything lined up correctly. The following is an aggregation off all the information I have rounded up.

So first of all the head unit I went with is the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000). The big reason I went with this unit is that this specific model comes with a built-in amplifier which means I don't have to mess around with trying to find a spot to mount an external amplifier and take up the little amount of cargo room the Celica has. The built in amp has a 45 watt RMS and up to 100 watts peak which lines up well with the Polk Audio speakers I purchased and should be plenty of power to drive them (The polk audio speakers have a very high db sensitivity; 91/92 db).

The wire receiver harness I got (which came for free with my Crutchfield order) is the [Metra 70-1761 Receiver Wiring Harness](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_120701761/Metra-70-1761-Receiver-Wiring-Harness.html). This is what the head unit wires will connect to and then in turn connect to the Celica's wire harness.

So here is the Celica's wire harness connectors with a diagram of the wire **factory colors** that are attached to the connectors.

![Celica wire harness connectors](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/celica-wire-harness-connectors.jpg) *Celica Wire Harness connectors*

![Main bigger wire harness connector (R3) diagram](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/wire-harness-connector-big.png) *Main bigger wire harness connector (R3) diagram [FL: Front Left, FR: Front Right]*

![Main smaller wire harness connector (R2) diagram](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/wire-harness-connector-small.png) *Main smaller wire harness connector (R2) diagram [RL: Rear Left, RR: Rear Right]*

Note that these colors **DO NOT MATCH** the [Metra 70-1761 Receiver Wiring Harness](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_120701761/Metra-70-1761-Receiver-Wiring-Harness.html) nor the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) unit wires. I'm assuming the wire color scheme used in the ST205 was an old obsolete scheme or maybe just a random scheme, not entirely sure.

Now here are the actual connections you will need to make. I've also added connections for the backup camera and the parking override bypass.

To clear a little confusion from the first table, both the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) and the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10)were grounded to the chassis. Using a ring terminal the Sony was grounded to a nut/bolt behind the center console and the Kicker to the a nut/bolt on the driveshaft tunnel. Also the constant power from both the head-unit and powered sub were routed through the firewall and to the positive battery terminal, more on this in a later section.

For the the connections from the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) to the Metra wiring harness that were 1:1 the [Kuject butt connectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B073RMRCC3) were used. All other connections I used the [WAGO 221 LEVER-NUTS](https://www.wago.com/us/lp-221). The personal reason for this was to have the flexibility to add or remove cables from these "non-permanent" connections without worrying about having to cut and resolder the wires. This will be convenient in the event if a new electrical device gets added or removed.

All other wires that were not used were electrical taped off such as the Metra's yellow constant or the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) brown and green input wires.

So the subwoofer I went with was the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10) which is a compact self powered 10" sub. For the same reason I got the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) I went with a self powered sub to save as much space as possible. I could not afford to use up any trunk space to put in a boxed sub and find somewhere to mount an amplifier.

The best place I found to install this sub was under the passenger seat. With the addition of a few washers for the rear left bolt, the seat is able to slide back and forth without hitting the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10).

![Kicker 46HS10 on floor behind passenger seat](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/sub-behind-seat.jpg) *Kicker 46HS10 on floor behind passenger seat*

![Kicker 46HS10 beneath passenger seat](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/sub-under-seat.jpg) *Kicker 46HS10 beneath passenger seat*

![Kicker 46HS10 hidden under passenger seat positioned all the way back](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/sub-hidden-under-seat.jpg) *Kicker 46HS10 hidden under passenger seat positioned all the way back*

**However** the grille on the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10) does come in contact with the seat if there is someone sitting on the seat. The washers did help a bit, but to my knowledge there are only 3 options one can do to alleviate this or fix it completely.

1. Buy the smaller 8" [Kicker Hideaway HS8](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway)
    - It is 3-1/4" height vs 3-3/8"
2. Hammer in the grille on the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10)
    - The grille sticks out unnecessarily compared to the frame and can be hammered flat without sacrificing sound
3. Lift the actual passenger seat
    - This is a lot of work. I used some washers on the rear left bolt which aided a bit in raising the seat, but the rear right bolt on the passenger seat is bolted on the side of the driveshaft tunnel. So adding washers there would not accomplish anything. Some custom fabrication will be required

The option that I went with is option #4, none of the above. Having someone in the seat did not affect the bass in any way nor create any unwanted rattle. However, if this grows to be a concern in the future i will probably go with option #2 as its the easiest.

To conceal the wire connections, cutting/drilling a hole in the carpet near the bottom of the driveshaft tunnel proved to be quite good.

![Kicker 46HS10 connection cable running through carpet near driveshaft tunnel](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/sub-wires-through-carpet.jpg) *Kicker 46HS10 connection cable running through carpet near driveshaft tunnel*

As seen in the picture above, I used a small step drill bit to cut a hole through the carpet. Make sure to cut this hole near the area where the connector on the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10) will  be to avoid any bending. The cables can then be ran up the driveshaft tunnel without any pinching and up to the center console location.

![Kicker 46HS10 connection cable coming out of the driveshaft tunnel](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/sub-wires-coming-out-of-drivrshaft.jpg) *Kicker 46HS10 connection cable coming out of the driveshaft tunnel*

Connecting the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10) to the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) was really easy with the purchase of the [Kicker 46KISL car audio amp amplifier speaker wire](https://www.kicker.com/2-channel-speaker-rca-converter) and the [AudioQuest rca adapter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009MFRW0). Just use some [butt connectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B073RMRCC3) to connect the subwoofer harness audio wires to the Kicker 46KISL adapter. Then attach the adapter rca end to the AudioQuest RCA adapter and that to the sub-out port on the Sony XAV-AX7000. Since the harness and the RCA adapter are both from kicker the wire color scheme connections are really easy:

|                        | Kicker 46HS10 | Kicker 46KISL |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Left Channel Positive  | White         | White         |
| Left Channel Negative  | White/Black   | White/Black   |
| Right Channel Positive | Grey          | Grey          |
| Right Channel Negative | Grey/Black    | Grey/Black    |

Mounting the subwoofer is also really easy. The [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10) does come with a few mounting brackets inside, but there was no real way to attach it to anything under the passenger seat. What I ended up doing is attaching two really long strips of double sided velcro to the back of the unit, but just using the side with the hooks so it can sink in and grab unto the carpet.

![Kicker 46HS10 with double sided adhesive velcro strap attached to the back of it](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/sub-with-velcro-strip.jpg) *Kicker 46HS10 with double sided adhesive velcro strap attached to the back of it*

Upon testing, once the velcro strips grab unto the carpet, it is not going anywhere. Keep in mind that removing this is a real pain in the butt unless you remove the passenger seat (learn from my dumb mistakes). Save this step for the end once everything else is done.

## Constant Battery Terminal Power

Both the [Kicker 46HS10](https://www.kicker.com/hideaway-hs10) and the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) are required/recommended to be connected directly to the car's positive battery terminal. This means you will have to run cables through the car's firewall. Luckily the ST205 has a convenient grommet you can go through on the passenger side. Located on the right side of the engine bay in the rear remove the two nuts holding the grommet and lift out (The grommet might be seized on, so some elbow grease might be required to yank off).

![Firewall grommet unsecured with two red power cables running through](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/firewall-grommet-power-wires.jpg) *Firewall grommet unsecured with two red power cables running through*

![Wires running below Firewall grommet wrapped in plastic shielding](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/power-wires-under-gommet.jpg) *Wires running below Firewall grommet wrapped in plastic shielding*

In the image above you can see I decided to run the power cables to the head unit and subwoofer underneath the grommet itself. You could also slit a hole through the rubber grommet and run it directly through. The Kicker 46HS10 already came with wiring to connect to the battery. For the Sony XAV-AX7000 I went with the [Crutchfield CK12](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_007CK12/Crutchfield-CK12.html) wiring kit to connect to the battery. After running the cables through the grommet and cutting it to the proper length, just connect it to the positive battery terminal and neatly apply some cable management to the wire to avoid any interference. You could also decide like myself to extend the Crutchfield CK12 lead to be able to hide the fuse on the right side the battery

![Head-unit and subwoofer power wiring connected to positive battery terminal](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/sub-and-headunit-power-connected.jpg) *Head-unit and subwoofer power wiring connected to positive battery terminal*

While this is properly and safely connected, I didn't like the look of these cables connecting to the battery terminal this way. I also have plans on adding fog lights which means I will have yet another cable connected to the terminal. This is where the [T-SPEC - Battery Terminal](https://www.tspeconline.com/product/V-BATT-TML) comes in. This terminal allows for 4 cable connections to be attached to the battery terminal. To get this installed just cut the existing terminal connector off of the starter and harness wire (I think this is what these are). Make sure to cut as little as possible as it will be a real pain to run new wires if cut too short.

![Existing starter and harness power cable cut](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/main-starter-sire-cut.jpg) *Existing starter and harness power cable cut*

Once cut we now need to extend them to be able to reach the battery terminal once again. I cut off my desired length of cable from the [THIKPO G420 Jumper Cables](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LW5HFPL) I purchased and attached it to the existing thicker starter cable (I think) using the  [Gardner Bender HSB-28](https://www.gardnerbender.com/en/p/HSB-28/Butt-Splice-Kit-8-2-AWG) to make the connection.

![Starter cable extended and connected to the T-SPEC connector with the harness cable extended as well](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/tspec-with-main-starter-connected.jpg) *Starter cable extended and connected to the T-SPEC connector*

I then cut off the ring terminals off the subwoofer and the Crutchfield CK12 wiring kit and attached them all to the T-SPEC connector.

![All power wires connected to the T-SPEC terminal](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/tspec-battery-terminal-done.jpg) *All power wires connected to the T-SPEC terminal*

As you can see I left a spot for my future fog lights on T-SPEC. One thing to note about this T-SPEC terminal is it did not properly fit on the battery terminal node. I had to actually pry it open a bit further and find a longer bolt to be able to secure it in properly. This might vary from battery to battery, but keep this in mind.

## Reverse Camera

The rear view camera I opted for was the [NATIKA Backup/Front View Camera](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H852D49). It is well reviewed and has decent picture quality for a pretty cheap camera. Unless you have a very specific reason, there is no need to get an expensive camera or anything with crazy high resolution since the main purpose of a back-up camera is to tell you if you are going to hit something or not. The place I settled to install the camera is the rear center panel. To get this panel off you will need to first remove all trunk trim panels. These are very straightforward and if you already removed the rear seats in the previous steps you will have easy access to the screws and plastic trim clips. You don't have to fully remove the panels, just enough to have enough space to work in. Once you are done with the panels the next step is to remove the rear tail lights. The rear tail lights are held in by three nuts as show below:

![Right rear taillight removed with nut locations circled](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-tail-light-removed.jpg) *Right rear taillight removed with nut locations circled*

My 1996 ST205 did not have any weather adhesive holding the rear taillights in like my 1994 STi (might be the same with all other ST205s). So with a little wiggling they were able to come off easily. Once the taillights are removed you will then see these two nuts (mine were pretty rusty) on either side of the rear center panel:

![Rear center panel bolt shown](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-center-panel-bolt.jpg) *Rear center panel bolt shown (9016360010)*

Once both bolts are remove the only thing holding this in place are 8 plastic retainers as seen here:

![Rear center panel removed with plastic retainers circled](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-center-panel-removed-side-view.jpg) *Rear center panel removed with plastic retainers circled*

The best way I found to remove these was spray a little bit of lubricant on the retainers themselves and using a rubber mallet to carefully hammer the retainers out from the trunk. Once you popped out all the retainers, unplug the rear license plate light cable and you are done.

![Rear center panel removed completely](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-center-panel-removed-completley.jpg) *Rear center panel removed completely*

Next step is to drill a hole in the panel for the backup camera (The NATIKA instructions recommended a 5/16" drill bit a believe). The place I settled for was the top of the panel above the license plate mounts:

![Rear center panel with hole drilled on top](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-center-panel-with-hole-drilled-for-camera.jpg) *Rear center panel with hole drilled on top*

![Rear center panel with hole drilled on top inside view](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-center-panel-with-hole-drilled-for-camera-2.jpg) *Rear center panel with hole drilled on top inside view*

To drill this hole I had to remove the bracket that held in the license plate lights. I then placed on the rear camera to make sure everything aligned well and was flush.

![Rear center panel with camera placed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-center-panel-with-rear-camera-placed.jpg) *Rear center panel with camera placed*

Once everything looks good, the last thing you will need to do is cut a hole on the license plate light bracket to allow the nut for the camera to spin freely and secure the camera on:

![Rear center panel showing camera installation nut](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-center-panel-showing-rear-camera-nut.jpg) *Hole cut on license plate light bracket to allow for nut spinning*

Once the camera is secure, run the camera wire into the trunk. I decided to use the existing grommet for the license plate lights cable. A more professional option would have been to drill a new hole for it, but this was works well enough. Now all that is left is to install everything in reverse order and with a bit of cleaning the final result will look pretty good:

![Rear center panel installed with NATIKA back-up camera](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-center-panel-installed-with_camera.jpg) *Rear center panel installed with NATIKA back-up camera*

Now run the camera wires back to the center console to plug into the head unit. I decided to run the wires on the passenger side and through a channel in the passenger door sill:

![Passenger door sill plate wire channel](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/passanger-door-sill-plate-wire-channel.jpg) *Passenger door sill plate wire channel*

With all the interior trim removed from the speaker installation this should be very easy. Just take your time and do some proper cable management. Also keep in mind that the NATIKA back-up camera comes with built in guide lines with the option to remove them bu cutting certain wires on the camera (read the instructions). I would recommend to not cut them yet and wait till everything is attached to the head unit for you to decide if you prefer the built in guide lines or use the ones on the Sony XAV-AX7000. I opted for the built in NAKITA guide lines and turned off the Sony guide lines in the settings.

### Reverse Camera Indicator

So the [Sony XAV-AX7000](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/car-marine-audio/receiver-players/p/xavax7000) has a feature (along with probably all other modern head units) that switches to reverse camera automatically when the car is put to reverse gear. This is the Purple/white wire on the Sony XAV-AX7000. Unfortunately the ST205 at least for the 1996 model does not feature a reverse indicator on the main harness. This means you will have to do some hunting on where to connect the purple/white wire to. There are two options you can do when it comes to the ST205.

1. Connect to the back-up light switch (Either the IL1 or IG1 connector)
2. Connect directly to the reverse tail light switch

Here is the diagram of the back-up switch:

![ST205 Back-up switch diagram](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/back-up-switch-diagram.png) *ST205 Back-up switch diagram (Pin 9 for IL1 and pin 10 for IG1)*

The IL1 connector is located in the engine near the engine control module:

![IL1 Connector Location](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/back-up-switch-il1.png) *IL1 Connector Location*

The IG1 is located in the kick panel:

![IG1 Connector Location](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/back-up-switch-ig1.png) *IG1 Connector Location*

I initially opted for the first option, but unfortunately I could not find the IG1 connection at all. The diagrams I provided were all the information I was going off and the diagram itself is reversed (it shows a left hand drive car). I think the IG1 is actually on the driver side somewhere, but i'm not 100% sure. I could have traced the rear tail-light wire from the lights, to the BQ1 connector (which is located on the right rear side near the suspension pillar), all the way to the IG1 connector, but even if I did find it there is hardly any room down near the foot panel. This would have been very annoying trying to splice a wire down there so instead I went with option #2.

Option #2 is the easiest and what I would recommend. If you already took off the trim and lights trying to install the reverse camera, this is incredibly easy.

First find the connector for the rear tail light. I choose to the rear-left light as I was already running the reverse camera through the passenger side. Once you found the connector, unplug it and find the red/white wire on it. This is the power to the back-up bulb (might not hurt to double check this with a buddy and a multi meter).

Once you find the correct wire, cut it and attach a 3 conductor [WAGO 221 lever nuts](https://www.wago.com/us/lp-221) to it. Two ports to restore the original connection, the third port to connect to the head unit.

![Rear left taillight splice with a WAGO 221 connector](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-taillight-splice.jpg) *Rear left taillight splice with a WAGO 221 connector*

The wire I used to attach to the Wago 221 lever nut and run to the head unit was a 18 gauge [TYUMEN 40FT 2 Pin](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LZRV0HV) wire. I simply cut it to length and removed the black wire to make it a single wire going back to the center console.

If everything is connected properly, the head unit will now automatically switch to rear camera once the reverse gear is engaged:
