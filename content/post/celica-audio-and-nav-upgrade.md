## Intro

So you bought yourself a JDM ST205 and want to upgrade the sound system to the 21st century? Well you are in luck as the process is very straight forward and hopefully with this article you will be able to do it easily and be ready for any roadblocks that I've run into.  

This article is not a complete guide and will assume you are capable of removing panels, soldering connections, crafting mounts, etc.

## Equipment Used

These are just the equipment I used for this project, feel free to swap whatever with your preferred brands.

## Interior Removal

So the first easy step to start this process is the removal of all the interior trim and rear seats to get access to the OEM speakers. Compared to other JDM cars I have worked with (just a Subaru GC8) this Celica has been simpler in my opinion.

The door cards/panels were straight forward. They both had two/tree plastic plugs that had screws underneath, so just pop the plugs with your plastic trim tools and undo the screws. There was also a hidden screw under the inner door handle plastic cup as seen here:

![Inner door handle cup removed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/door-handle-cup-removed.jpg) *Passenger door handle trim cup removed*

Then once you remove all these screws and plastic retainers and with a little bit of wiggling, you can remove the door panels/cards very easily.

![Passenger door panel removal](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/door-panel-off.jpg) *Passenger door panel removed*

After this you can start the removal of the rear seats and the rear side trim (the trim that contains the rear speakers). This as well is very simple. The rear speaker grilles can be popped off with a trim tool to reveal additional screws to remove. The only small tricky part I recall is the bottom portion of the rear seat, once you unbolt everything, you have to yank the front part of it out from the car frame. It is connected by two metal hooks that lock into the "lock hook" mechanism. The red circles on the image show where these hooks go into.

![Rear seat and trim removed](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-seat-off-and-trim.jpg) *Rear seat and trim removed. Red circle shows the hook lock (there is another one on the other side)*

Once you are done removing all the necessary trim you can now unplug and unscrew both the front and rear speakers. Now since your Celica is over 25 years old they will prob look a little bit like this:

![Old rear speakers](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-old-speakers.jpg) *Old rear speakers*

The front speaker diaphragms were a bit petrified and the foam was starting to fall apart. The rears faired a bit better, but still in a poor state. I'm not too knowledgeable when it comes to speaker technology, but to me this is one of the downsides to using paper as a woofer material. Humid conditions, like the ones found in Japan, lead to a deterioration in the speakers over time. Now granted this is over 25+ years, but i'm sure if polypropylene cones were used back then (if the technology existed in the 90's not sure) the old oem speakers would have held off much better. I'm sure paper technology and chemical coatings have come a long way since then, but im still hesitant to use or recommend paper speaker woofers because of this. These were not so bad compared to the ones found on my 1994 WRX STi:

![Old GC8 speaker](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/old-gc8-speaker.jpg) *Really old and petrified 1994 WRX STi speaker*

Regardless, with this mini rant out of the way lets move on to the next section.

## Installing the new speakers

Take the new speakers you ordered, remove them from their packaging, and then come to the realization that they do not fit properly and the included speaker adapters won't work either. Unfortunately I ran into this issue when my small brain blindly trusted Crutchfield that a 6.5" speaker will work in the front and a 5.25" speaker will work in the back.

Now on the Mr. Brightside I wanted to use the Polk Audio DB speakers regardless as they are reviewed very well and I have used them in my 94 STi and liked the quality. Here are the new speaker in comparison to the Celica speaker brackets:

![Polk Audio DB6502 inside front Celica speaker bracket](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-new-speaker-inside-old-frame.jpg) *Polk Audio DB6502 inside front Celica speaker bracket*

![Polk Audio DB5252 inside rear Celica speaker bracket](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-new-speaker-inside-old-frame.jpg) *Polk Audio DB5252 inside rear Celica speaker bracket*

As you can see the mounting screws do not line up properly on either bracket. The front speaker brackets have a screw spacing of 8" and the rear speaker bracket has a screw spacing of 6.25". I can't recall exactly, but I kinda remember trying the 6.25" DB6502 speaker in the rear and it *STILL* did not line up properly. Looking online I found some threads stating certain 8" speakers worked like the [Focal ISU 200](https://www.focal.com/en/car-audio/car-audio-kits-solutions/integration/universal/component-kits/isu200) will work on the front speaker bracket without any modifications, but chances are the speakers you prefer or want buy will require some modification and crafting.

Hopefully you are better equipped than me, but all the following custom speaker adapters were done with just a [Dremel 4000-6/50](https://us.dremel.com/en_US/products/-/show-product/tools/4000-6-50-high-performance-rotary-tool-kit?bvroute=Reviews%2FshowHelpfulPositive). The adapters a little sloppy around the edges, but It did not turn out too bad.

### Rear speakers

I first started by removing the old speakers from the bracket (you will need to desolder the wire connections as they hardwired/soldered on). Then I flipped the speaker over a birch plywood I bought from Home Depot and drew a rough outline of the built in adapter frame the old speaker had. In the middle of the outline I then drew a circle slightly smaller than the DB5252 speaker to allow the speaker edge to rest on the plywood and not fall through.

![Rear speaker adapter outline on a birch plywood](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-speaker-adapter-outline.jpg) *Birch plywood with rear speaker adapter outline*

This is the [birch plywood squares](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Handprint-1-4-in-x-12-in-x-12-in-Birch-Plywood-438046/315171651) i bought from Home Depot:

![Birch plywood square](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/birch-plywood.jpg) *Birch plywood square bought at Home Depot*

With the aftermath of a lot sawdust everywhere, I drilled out the outlines with the Dremel:

![Rear speaker adapter cut out](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-speaker-adapter-hole-cut.jpg) *Rear speaker adapter cutout*

And was able to secure the speaker with cheap nuts and bolts I have bought from Harbor Freight:

![Rear speaker adapter complete](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-new-speaker-adapter.jpg) *Rear speaker adapter complete*

Like I mentioned before if you have proper equipment this part would not be so bad. I went through a few birch plywoods before I finally cut one half way decent. If you do not have better equipment or have the same mediocre woodwork skills as me, making these brackets will take a little bit of time, but should not hamper your progress. If possible might I suggest trying to create these brackets out of plastic rather than birch wood for increased durability and humidity resistance. Once finished creating the brackets add a bit of [blue loctite 242](https://www.loctiteproducts.com/en/products/specialty-products/specialty/loctite_threadlockerblue242.html) (or equivalent) to prevent the nuts from shaking loose and a bit of foam as seen on the picture above to prevent any rattling against the speaker grille.

As far as the wiring in concerned, all I would recommend is to extend the existing cables you desoldered with a [16 gauge speaker wire](https://www.crutchfield.com/p_007CSW16/Crutchfield-Speaker-Wire-16-gauge.html) using the [Kuject butt connectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B073RMRCC3) and adding a spade connectors from the [Nilight Quick Disconnect Terminals](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V35375X) kit. The results will look something like so:

![Rear speaker wire extended with spade connectors attached](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-speaker-wire-extension.jpg) *Rear speaker wire extended with spade connectors attached*

![Rear speaker wire extension connected](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/rear-speaker-wire-complete.jpg) *Rear speaker wire extension connected*

### Front Speakers

The front speaker adapters are much easier to cut out than the rears. The rears had this rounded square shape going on which made routing the outlines free handed with only a Dremel way too annoying. The front adapters are just a 8" diameter circle with another circle in the middle to let the front speakers rest on it. So unless you are buying an 8" speaker that will avoid all this your first step will be to remove the sticky sealant from the speaker and the frame.

![Cutting through the weatherstrip adhesive on the front speaker and bracket using a small pick](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-speaker-sticky-stuff.jpg) *Cutting through the weatherstrip adhesive on the front speaker and bracket using a small pick*

After you pry the speaker off and desolder the wires off, flip that speaker over on top your wood panel, trace the speaker outline and screw holes, and then start cutting.

![Front speaker flipped over on birch plywood](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-speaker-flipped-on-birch.jpg) *Front speaker flipped over on birch plywood*

![Front adapter fully cut](/images/celica-audio-and-nav-upgrade/front-birch-adapter-inner-circle-cut.jpg) *Front adapter fully cut*

Once everything is fully cut mount the adapter to the front speaker bracket (make sure to add some [3M Weatherstrip adhesive](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b5005005008/) between the adapter and the bracket), attach the speaker and secure it with hardware, and finally add some foam to the edges of the adapter to prevent and rattling sounds of it hitting the door panel.

Now all you have to do is add some [spade connectors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V35375X) to the wires you soldered and attach them to the speaker terminals.
